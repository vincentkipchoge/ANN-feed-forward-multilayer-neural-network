# ANN-feed-forward-multilayer-neural-network
This is an implementation of a feed-forward multilayer neural network (ANN) with one-biased neuron in the input layer that can perform the classification task on the Iris dataset.

Analysis:

The 5-6-3 architecture has a larger hidden layer (6 nodes), allowing it to capture more intricate patterns in the data compared to the 5-2-3 architecture with a smaller hidden layer (2 nodes). The larger hidden layer might provide more capacity for the model to learn from the data, but it also increases the risk of overfitting, especially for a relatively small dataset like Iris.
